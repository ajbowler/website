      <p>
        I'm currently a consultant at Client Resources, Inc. lending my React expertise to an otherwise Angular-focused shop. I'm currently
        building a single-page-app in an AWS environment with authentication powered by Amazon Cognito and a Python backend.

      <div className="subtitle is-5">Hayneedle</div>
      <p>
        I was a Senior Software Engineer, helping replatform a legacy Coldfusion nightmare into a modern platform built on <strong>React, Node, and Java</strong>
        with all the fun toys like <strong>Redux, Spring, JPA, and GraphQL</strong>, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've helped them convert entire pages over to React and consume their in-house REST APIs, and even an GraphQL integration towards the end of my time there. Notable projects include,
        but are not limited to: Checkout redesign, Apple Pay integration, and California Consumer Privacy Act compliance.
      </p>
      <div className="subtitle is-5">Cerner</div>
      <p>
        I worked at Cerner for a couple years prior to Hayneedle, fresh out of college. I was full stack there,
        writing <strong>Rails</strong> applications for various nursing workflows, powered by <strong>RESTful Java services</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also mentored new engineers going through the training program as I once did, teaching them how to succeed
        at the company. I taught them things such as unit testing best practices and how to attack code reviews, among other things.

      <div className="subtitle is-5">Principal Financial Group</div>
      <p>
        During college I interned at Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, IA for a couple summers. I wrote
        mostly <strong>Java</strong> and vanilla <strong>JavaScript</strong> there.
