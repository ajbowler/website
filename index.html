    <div id="about">
      <p>I'm Andrew Bowler, and welcome to my website. I'm currently a junior attending Iowa State University pursuing a Bachelor's in Software Engineering. My interests for my field, to name but a select few, are web development (JavaScript is beast!), computer graphics, video game development, and music technology. These only scratch the surface in what I'm interested in. My personal interests consist of video games, music, deliciously unhealthy food, and cats.

      <p>
        I'm most experienced with participating in enterprise scale applications as well as front-end web development. Languages I'm most familiar with are Java, C/C++, and HTML/JavaScript. Check out my resume for more details.

        Previously I worked as an Application Developer Intern for Principal Financial Group on the Distributed Application Hosting team in Information Services. Yeah, that was a mouthful. ANYWAY. It gave me valuable experience with working for a large company on existing enterprise software, and gave me the opportunity to work with both veterans in the industry and fellow interns.

        Outside of the software field, I have been an electric guitarist since the 8th grade with some professional training, and I love playing any sort of hard rock, though I have participated in my high school jazz and show choir bands as well, in addition to some bass guitar for the marching and concert bands.

            M(usic)14 is a semester project I worked on with 3 other classmates/friends I've known for a while. It is a music player that runs in the web browser and connects to an MPD server you provide (for you Linux users!) This allows you to stream the music library you own on your desktop computer to anywhere you have an Internet connection!
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project we decided to take the opportunity to learn the React JavaScript framework, and have discovered that it is a very fun framework to play around with, and there even exists a pre-built library of Bootstrap components rebuilt for React! We also utilized WebSockets, Node.js, and a RESTful service using Apache Tomcat.

            This one was for another class project a while back but I am proud of it, nonetheless. Our professor Derrick Stolee created a basic clone of Pac-Man, and instructed us to implement the AI for the enemies, the hero (for when the enemies were supposed to win), and even the powerups as they try to avoid the hero and make the enemies win!

        I plan on adding some personal projects to the list as well when I have time/the ideas are more fleshed out/I'm not eating a delicious thing. Tune next week on Dragon Ball Z.

        This is on the backburner at the moment while I focus on school and get the income to get proper recording equipment. Here's a composition I wrote for my music technology class a while back.

      I'm studying abroad at the University of Birmingham in England from January to June 2015! In this section I'll post some of the highlights of my 5 month experience, and I hope it will benefit future Brum students. Stay tuned!
